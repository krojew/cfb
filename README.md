# CFB Encoding

## [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nervosnetwork/cfb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nervosnetwork/cfb)

CFB (Canonical FlatBuffers) is a restricted variant of FlatBuffers for producing unequivocal transfer syntax.

## Usage

Install the code geneartor as commane line utility:

```
pip install -U cfbc
```

First generate bfbs file from fbs:

```
flatc -b --schema example.fbs
```

Then generate rust files from bfbs:

```
cfbc example.bfbs
```

### Use Verifier with flatbuffers rust

-   Add the generated `<name>_generated_verifier.rs` to the project in the same
    directory with the file `<name>_generated.rs` generated by `flatc -r`.
-   Add crate `flatbuffers-verifier` as a dependency in Cargo.toml.
-   Use the same version of `flatbuffers` as in `flatbuffers-verifier`.

```
flatbuffers-verifier = "0.2.0"
flatbuffers = "0.6.0"
```

The crate `flatbuffers-verifier` defines a function `get_root`, which is intended to replace the
function with the same name in `flatbuffers`. This function will verify the
buffer, and returns a `Result` to indicate whether the buffer is valid.
